Email-notifier is a tool developed to check new arrivals of email
in your mailbox via IMAP connection.

This is a command line tool.

By using Email-notifier you no longer need to keep open your mail client or browser just 
to check whether there is a new mail or not. now u can do it directly from your terminal 
while working.
